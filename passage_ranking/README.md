# Passage Ranking Task

The first task focuses on passage ranking. We have two subtasks related to this: Full ranking and top-1000 re-ranking.

In context of full ranking subtask, given a question, you are expected to rank passages from the full collection in terms of their likelihood of containing an answer to the question. You can submit up to 1000 passages for this task.

In context of top-1000 re-ranking subtask, we will be providing you with an initial ranking of 1000 passages (with no particular order) and you are expected to re-rank these passages based on their likelihood of containing an answer to the question.
