# Document Ranking Task

Similar to the passage ranking task, the document ranking task also has a full ranking and re-ranking subtasks.

In the full ranking subtask, you are expected to rank documents based on their relevance to the question, where documents can be retrieved from the full document collection provided. You can submit up to 1000 documents for this task.

In the re-ranking subtask, we will be providing you with an initial ranking of 100 documents and you are expected to re-rank these documents in terms of their relevance to the question.
